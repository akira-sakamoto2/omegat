    <para><application>OmegaT</application> is a free multi platform Computer
    Aided Translation tool, with the following highlights:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation
        memory:</emphasis><application> OmegaT</application> stores your
        translations in a translation memory file. At the same time, it can
        use memories files from previous translations for reference.
        Translation memories can be very useful in a translation where there
        are numerous repetitions or reasonably similar segments of text.
        OmegaT uses translation memories to store your previous translations
        and then suggest likely translations for the text you are currently
        working on.</para>

        <para>These translation memories can be very useful when a document
        that has already been translated needs to be updated. Unchanged
        sentences are automatically translated, while updated sentences are
        shown with the translation of the most similar, older sentence.
        Modifications to the original document are thus handled with greater
        ease. If you are supplied with previously created translation memories
        , for example by your translation agency or your client, OmegaT is
        able to use these as reference memories.</para>

        <para>OmegaT uses the standard tmx file format to store and access
        translation memories, which guarantees that you can exchange your
        translation material with other CAT applications supporting this file
        format.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Terminology management</emphasis>:
        Terminology management is important for translation consistency.
        OmegaT uses glossaries containing translations of single words or
        small phrases: a simplified bilingual dictionary for a specific
        domain. For your reference, OmegaT displays the translation of any
        word that is both present in the segment and registered in the glossary.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation process:</emphasis> Imagine
        having to translate something; from a single file to a folder
        containing subfolders each with a number of files in a variety of
        formats. When you let OmegaT know the files that you need to
        translate, it looks for the files it understands based on file
        filtering rules, recognizes the textual parts within them, splits up
        the text groups according to the segmentation rules, and displays the
        segments one by one so that you can proceed with the translation.
        OmegaT stores your translations and proposes possible translations
        from similar segments registered in the translation memory files. 
        When you are ready to view the final product, you can export the
        translated files, open them in the appropriate application and view
        the translation in the final format...</para>

        tools work with textual units called segments. In OmegaT, segments can

        segmentation is less frequently used, but can be useful in cases of
        so-called "creative" texts. The rule-based segmentation is usually
        synonymous with sentence-based segmentation. A number of rule sets are

        search for segments with two or more consecutive spaces. In this case
        the regular expression ^s^s+ would be used to find and list the

        <primary>Menu Project</primary>
        <secondary>New...</secondary>
      </indexterm>

    <para>To start using OmegaT, first create a project that will hold all
    your files, such as your source file, translation memories, glossaries,
    and eventually your translated file. In the <guimenu>Project</guimenu>
    menu, select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>New...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
    and type a name for your project. Remember where you are
    creating the project, because you will need to return to it later.</para>

    <para>After you give your project a name, the <guilabel>Create New Project</guilabel> dialog
    will open. At the top of that dialog, select your source file's language
    and the language that your translated file will be, and click
    <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to continue.</para>

    <para>If you are interested in other settings of this dialog,
    you can return to it any time by pressing <keycap>Ctrl+E.</keycap></para>

    <para>Next, the <guilabel>Project Files</guilabel> dialog opens. Click on <guibutton>Copy Files to Source Folder...</guibutton> to select your source files. OmegaT will then copy the selected
    files to the <filename>/source/</filename> subfolder of your newly created
    project. After the source files have loaded in the <guilabel>Editor</guilabel> pane, you can
    close the <guilabel>Project Files</guilabel> dialog.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="translate.the.segments.one.by.one">
    <title>Translate the file</title>

    <para>OmegaT will present one segment at a time for you to translate.
    After you have translated each segment, press <keycap>Ctrl+U</keycap> to
    move to the next untranslated segment (or <keycap>Ctrl+Shift+U</keycap> to
    move to the next translated segment). Whenever you want to see what your
    translation will look like in its final format, press
    <keycap>Ctrl+D</keycap> to generate the translated documents, which will be
    created in the <filename>/target/</filename> subfolder of your project folder. During
    translation, use the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> and <guimenu>Go To</guimenu>
    menus to perform various useful functions.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Validate your tags</title>

    <para>If your source files are formatted files, e.g. Microsoft Word,
    LibreOffice Writer or HTML, OmegaT will convert the formatting into tags
    that surround the text that you translate. Often documents will also have
    tags that have nothing to do with formatting, but which are also
    important in the source files (and in the translated files). A source
    sentence might look like:
    
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject role="html">
        <imagedata align="justify" fileref="images/InstantGuide_1.png"/>
      </imageobject>
      <imageobject role="fo">
        <imagedata align="justify" fileref="images/InstantGuide_1.png" width="40%"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    </para>

    <para>OmegaT, however, will present this sentence in the following
    fashion:
    
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject role="html">
        <imagedata align="justify" fileref="images/InstantGuide_2.png"/>
      </imageobject>
      <imageobject role="fo">
        <imagedata align="justify" fileref="images/InstantGuide_2.png" width="45%"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    </para>
    
    <para>The tags in OmegaT are greyed, so they are easy to recognise. They
    are protected, so that you cannot modify their contents, but you can delete them, enter them by hand or move
    them around in the target sentence. However, if you made mistakes when you
    typed the formatting tags, your translated files might fail to open.
    Therefore, press <keycap>Ctrl+Shift+V</keycap> before you generate your
    translated files, to validate that your tags are correct.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Generate the translated file</title>

    <para>Once you have made certain that there are no tag errors in your
    translation, press <keycap>Ctrl+D</keycap> to generate the target files,
    which will be created in the <filename>/target/</filename> subfolder of
    your project folder.</para>

        folder. The <filename>level1</filename> and <filename>level2</filename> memories can be shared with users of
        other translation programs. The memory named <filename>omegat</filename> can be used by
        OmegaT itself, in future projects that you create. If you place such
        translation memory files in the <filename>/tm/</filename> subfolder of a project,
        OmegaT will automatically search them for similar segments, called

    <para>Java Web Start technology (part of Java 1.6 and above) can be used

    application will be deployed, as well as the correct version of the Java
    Runtime Environment (JRE) used. To start OmegaT for the first time with
    Java Web Start, load the following URL in your browser:</para>

    <para>Download the file<emphasis>

    version (which may appear as "unrestricted access to the computer") are
    identical to the permissions you give to the local version, i.e., they
    allow access to the hard drive of the computer. Subsequent clicks on
    <emphasis><application>OmegaT</application>.jnlp</emphasis> will check for
    any upgrades, install them, if there are any, and then start

        <secondary>Command line launching</secondary>
      </indexterm></title>

    <para>Normally, it is not necessary to start
    <application>OmegaT</application> from the command line. However, the
    command-line alternative allows the user to control and modify the
    program's behavior. There are two ways of launching
    <application>OmegaT</application> using the command line.</para>

    <section id="method1.opening.commandline.window">
      <title>Opening a command line window</title>

      <para>A command line window is also referred to as a "terminal window".
      On Windows it is called an "MS-DOS window" and is available from the
      Start Menu, inside Programs, through the "MS-DOS" item. The Mac OS X
      equivalent is the application Terminal located in Applications →
      Utilities.</para>

      <para>To launch <application>OmegaT</application>, you must normally
      type two commands. The first of these is:</para>

      <para><emphasis> <literal>cd {folder}</literal> </emphasis></para>

      <para>where<emphasis> {folder}</emphasis> is the name of the folder,
      with complete path, in which your <application>OmegaT</application>
      program - specifically, the file
      <emphasis><application>OmegaT</application>.jar</emphasis> - is located.
      In practice, this command will therefore be something like this:</para>

      <para>On Windows</para>

      <para><emphasis> <literal>cd C:\Program
      Files\<application>OmegaT</application></literal> </emphasis></para>

      <para>On Mac OS X</para>

      <para><literal> <literal>cd &lt;<application>OmegaT</application>.app
      location&gt;/<application>OmegaT</application>.app/Contents/Resources/Java/</literal>
      </literal></para>

      <para>On Linux</para>

      <para><literal>cd /usr/local/omegat</literal></para>

      <para>This command changes the folder to the folder containing the
      executable <application>OmegaT</application> file. The second command is
      the command which actually launches <application>OmegaT</application>.
      In its most basic form, this command is:</para>

      <para><literal>java -jar
      <application>OmegaT</application>.jar</literal></para>

      <para>Pay attention to the capitalization - in OS other than Windows,
      the program will not start, if you enter <emphasis>omegat</emphasis>
      instead of <emphasis>OmegaT </emphasis>!</para>

      <para>This method has a particular benefit of being suitable for finding
      causes of problems: if an error occurs during use of the program, an
      error message is output in the terminal window which may contain useful
      information on the cause of the error.</para>

      <para>The above method somewhat impractical way of launching a program
      routinely. For this reason, the two commands described above are
      contained in a file (a "script", also called a ".bat file" on Windows
      systems).</para>

      <para>When this file is executed, the commands within it are
      automatically carried out. Consequently, to make changes to the launch
      command, it is sufficient to modify the file.</para>

      <para>The basic command has already been mentioned above. Changes to
      this command involve the addition of "arguments" to it. Arguments are
      added after the initial <emphasis>"java"</emphasis>, and before the
      <emphasis>"-jar <application>OmegaT</application>.jar"</emphasis>. Note
      that in Windows you can change the
      <emphasis><application>OmegaT</application>.l4J.ini</emphasis> file to
      reflect your preferences. On Mac OS X, you can change the
      <emphasis>Info.plist</emphasis> located in

              <tertiary>User interface language</tertiary>
            </indexterm> Normally, i.e. when <application>OmegaT</application>
          is launched without any arguments, the program first detects the
          language of the user's operating system. If a user interface in this
          language is available, <application>OmegaT</application> uses it.
          So, if the user's operating system is Russian and
          <application>OmegaT</application> has been localized in Russian,
          <application>OmegaT</application> is displayed with a Russian user
          interface, Russian menus, etc. If the language of the user's system
          is not available, <application>OmegaT</application> defaults to
          English. This is the standard behavior.</para>

          <para>The <emphasis>"-Duser.language=XX"</emphasis> argument causes
          <application>OmegaT</application> to use the language specified
          rather than the language of the user's operating system. "XX" in the
          command stands for the two-digit code of the desired language. To
          launch <application>OmegaT</application> with a French interface
          (for example on a Russian operating system), the command would
          therefore be:</para>

    <para>Note that you will need the ant program
    (<emphasis>http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi</emphasis>) to build your
    own version of OmegaT. Unpack the
    <emphasis>OmegaT_3.n.n_Source.zip</emphasis> file and enter the
    OmegaT_3.n.n_Source folder or enter the <emphasis>./omegat/</emphasis>
    folder of the SVN checked out code. Please make sure that a build.xml
    file is present in that folder. Then, on the command line, type:</para>

    <para>From a practical point of view, the most important pair of numbers
    is the second pair: it tells, how much you have done so far, in relation
    to the total or second number. The project in the example is evidently
    finished, as all the unique segments have been translated.</para>

    <section id="editor.pane">

          <primary>Windows and panes in OmegaT</primary>

          <secondary>Editor pane</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>This is where you type and edit your translation. The Editor pane
      displays the text of the partially translated document: the text already
      translated is displayed in translation while the untranslated text is
      displayed in the original language. The displayed text is split into
      segments and you may scroll through the document and double-click on any
      segment to open and edit it. In the above case, the segments already
      translated are shown in yellow.</para>

      <para>One of the above segments is the current segment. It is the
      segment that is displayed in two parts. The upper part is in the source
      language, in bold characters with a green background color, the lower
      part is the editing field, ended by a marker: <indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Segment marker</primary>
        </indexterm>the marker is <literal>&lt;segment nnnn&gt;</literal>
      where nnnn is a number of the segment in the project. Use the upper part
      as a reference and replace or modify the contents of the editing field
      with your translation.</para>

      <para>Depending upon the preferred editing behavior, the editing field
      for the untranslated segment may be empty, contain the source text, or
      contain the translation of the string most similar to the one to be
      translated. When you move to another segment, the translation is
      validated and stored. If you want the translation to be the same as the
      source, simply make the editing field empty by removing all the text
      (select all with <keycap>Ctrl+A</keycap> and delete with
      <keycap>Del</keycap>). OmegaT is able to store translations that are
      identical to the source. This is useful for documents that contain trade
      marks, names or other proper nouns, or parts in a third language that do
      not require translation. See <emphasis>Translation editing</emphasis>
      for more details.</para>

      <para>If you right click on the Editor pane, a pop-up menu opens,
      offering<emphasis role="bold"> Cut, Copy, Paste</emphasis> (i.e. same

      <para>The match viewer shows the most similar segments from translation
      memories, both from internal project translation memory created in real
      time as you translate your project and from ancillary translation
      memories you have imported from your earlier jobs, or received from your
      client or translation agency.</para>

      <para>When you move to the next segment, the first fuzzy match (the one
      with the best matching percentage) is automatically selected. You may
      select a different match by pressing <guimenuitem>Ctrl+2, 3, 4, or
      5</guimenuitem>.<indexterm>
          <primary>Shortcuts</primary>

          <secondary>Selecting the match - Ctrl+N</secondary>
        </indexterm> Of course, pressing <keycombo>
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>

          <keycap>5</keycap>
        </keycombo> will have no effect, if there is no match #5. To use the
      selected match in your translation, use
      <guimenuitem>Ctrl+R</guimenuitem><indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Shortcuts</primary>

          <secondary>Replace text - Ctrl+R</secondary>
        </indexterm> to replace the target field with the match or use
      <guimenuitem>Ctrl+I <indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Shortcuts</primary>

          <secondary>Insert text - Ctrl+I</secondary>
        </indexterm></guimenuitem> to insert it at the cursor position.</para>

      <para>The matching percentage is roughly equivalent to taking the number
      of common words in the matched and the matching segment and dividing by
      the number of words in the longer of the two. The selected fuzzy match
      is highlighted in bold, words that are missing in the segment you are
      translating are colored blue and words adjacent to the missing parts
      green. In the above example the source segment is <emphasis role="bold">Context menu command</emphasis>. The top match is 100%,
      because all words match. So do the next two matches, and the match #4 is
      similar, but different. The line with the matching percentage also
      includes the name of the translation memory <indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Translation memories</primary>

          <secondary>Matches</secondary>
        </indexterm> containing the match. If there's no file name displayed,
      the source is the internal project translation memory. Orphan
      segments<indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Translation memories</primary>

          <secondary>Orphan segments</secondary>
        </indexterm> (the match #2) describe segments in the default project
      translation memory that have no corresponding source segment.</para>

      <para>There are actually three match estimates available (66/66/30 in
      the case of the match #4 above). They are defined as follows:</para>

      <para>Modifying the segmentation rules may have the effect of modifying

      <para>Tags are highlighted in bold blue for easy comparison between the
      original and the translated contents. Click on the link to jump to the
      segment in the Editor pane. Correct the error if necessary and press
      <guimenuitem>Ctrl+T</guimenuitem> to return to the tag validation window
      to correct other errors. In the first and third case above tags are
      paired incorrectly, and in the second case the &lt; sign is missing from
      the starting tag.</para>

      <para>Tag errors are cases in which the tags in the translation do not
      correspond in order and number to the original segment. Some tag
      scenarios flagged in the tag validation window are necessary and are
      benign, others will cause problems when the translated document is
      created. Tags generally represent some kind of formatting in the
      original text. Simplifying the original text formatting in the source
      file before commencing translation greatly contributes to reducing the
      number of tags.</para>

      <para>The match statistics are accessed via<guimenuitem>Tools&gt;Match
      Statistics.</guimenuitem> The evaluation is rather CPU intensive and can
      be time-consuming, so a progress bar is shown during the calculation. As
      far as categories are concerned, the de facto industry standard of
      classifying matches into the following groups is used: Repetitions, Exact match,
      95%-100%, 85%-94%, 75%-84%, 50%-74% and No match. This information is
      computed for segments as well as for words and for characters (without
      and including spaces). Note that there could be minor differences
      between the OmegaT counts and the numbers, provided by other CAT
      tools.<figure>

        </figure></para>

      <para>Note that these totals are a good (or as good as they can be)
      approximation of the work involved in the project and thus can serve as
      a basis for your cost and price calculations.</para>

      <para>Spaces between segments are not taken into account in the last
      column. Repetitions stand for identical segments present several times
      in the text. The first segment and its contents will be classified as
      "no match", and the rest of them as a repetition of the first. If the
      translation for several identical source segments already exists in the
      translation memory of the project, these segments, together with other,
      already translated unique segments, will be classified as an "Exact
      match". The number of unique segments, if needed, is provided in the
      standard statistics window, regardless of whether they have been
      translated or not.</para>

      <para>The rest of the categories (50-100%) involves untranslated
      segments with a fuzzy match. Fuzzy matches can come from the
      <filename>/tm</filename> folder as well - and not just from the internal
      translation memory in <filename>/omegaT,</filename> as is the case for
      repetitions and exact matches. The only difference with matches from the
      <filename>project_save</filename> translation memory is that external
      TMs cannot give exact matches, only 100%. If one does not wish to use
      external TMs for counting, one will either have to empty the /tm folder
      or change the project setup (temporarily) so that the value for /tm
      points to a different location.</para>

      <para>The Match Statistics are tab-separated and you can use
      <guimenuitem>Ctrl+A <indexterm class="singular">

      spreadsheet or into your cost-accounting application. Once computed, the
      data also available in

      is time-stamped, as the calculation (contrary to the standard
      statistics) is not instantaneous and can thus quickly become
      obsolete.</para>

    <para>All of OmegaT's functions are available through the menu bar at the
    top of the Editor window. Most functions are also available via keyboard
    shortcuts. Shortcuts are activated by pressing <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> and a
    letter. Some shortcuts involve other keys. For readability purposes,
    letters are written in uppercase here. <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> is used on
    Windows, UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems with keyboards featuring a
    <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> or <keycap>Control</keycap> key. Mac users should
    instead use <keycombo>
        <keycap>Cmd</keycap>

        <keycap>key</keycap>
      </keycombo> instead. The "Cmd" key either has a "command" label or an

    <para>It is possible to modify the project properties during a translation

    you have some experience with OmegaT, it is safest to consider all
    settings final once the translation has started – unless of course you
    realize a major mistake has been made. See the section Preventing data

        <para>You can either enter the source and target languages by hand or
        use the drop down menus. Bear in mind that changing the languages may
        render the currently used translation memories useless since their

          <secondary>Enable Sentence-level segmentation</secondary>
        </indexterm>

        <para>The segmentation settings only address the way the source files
        are handled by <application>OmegaT</application>. The predominant way
        of segmenting the sources is the sentence-level segmenting, so this
        check box should in a normal case be left checked.</para>

        <para>In some seldom cases the alternative, i.e. segmenting by
        paragraphs, may be preferred. Changing this flag does not modify the
        segmentation of already existing translation memories. If you decide
        mid-translation to switch from sentence to paragraph translation, the
        internal translation memory of the project will not be changed (OmegaT
        may upgrade old translation memories that did not use sentence
        segmentation, but not vice versa).</para>

        <para>Changing segmentation settings may cause some already translated
        segments to be split or merged. This will effectively return them to
        the "untranslated" status, as they will no longer match segments
        recorded in the project memory, even though their original translation
        is still there.</para>

        <para>The segmentation rules are generally valid across all the

        specific to the project in question. Use this button to open a

        segmentation rules as desired. The new set of rules will be stored

        <para>In a similar fashion as above the user can create
        project-specific File filters, which will be stored together with the

        project specific filters</guimenuitem> check box in the window, that
        opens. A copy of the changed filters configuration will be stored with
        the project. To delete project specific file filters, uncheck the

        <para>In case there are non-unique segments in source documents, the

        translated segment will be assumed as the default translation and its
        target text will be automatically used for later hits during the
        translation process. Mistranslated segments can of course be corrected
        later manually using <guimenuitem>Create Alternative
        Translation</guimenuitem>. If the Auto-propagation check box is not
        checked, the segments with alternative translations are left

        open the target documents, as only inline tags are removed.

        OmegaT editor) is retained in target documents.</para>

        key-value pairs for tags to be left untranslated. For the example
        above, the field would contain: <literal>class=hide, translate=no

    To add a new file filter pattern, click <emphasis role="bold">Add</emphasis>. The same dialog is used to add a pattern or to

      <para>When OmegaT encounters a file in its source folder, it attempts to
      select the filter based upon the file's extension. More precisely,
      OmegaT attempts to match each filter's source filename patterns against
      the filename. For example, the pattern <literal>*.xhtml
      </literal>matches any file with the <literal>.xhtml</literal> extension.
      If the appropriate filter is found, the file is assigned to it for
      processing. For example, by default, XHTML filters are used for
      processing files with the .xhtml extension. You can change or add
      filename patterns for files to be handled by each file. Source filename
      patterns use wild card characters similar to those used in <emphasis role="bold">Searches. </emphasis>The '*' character matches zero or more
      characters. The '?' character matches exactly one character. All other
      characters represent themselves. For example, if you wish the text
      filter to handle readme files (<literal>readme, read.me</literal>, and
      <literal>readme.txt</literal>) you should use the pattern
      <literal>read*</literal>.</para>

      <para>Only a limited number of file formats specify a mandatory

      the default encoding of your operating system. You may change the source
      encoding for each different source filename pattern. Such files may also

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Translation project files: These constitute a translation project.
      Losing them may affect the project's integrity and your ability to

  <section id="translation.project.files">
    <title>Translation project files</title>

    <indexterm class="singular">
      <primary>Project files</primary>

      <secondary>Translation project files</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>An <application>OmegaT</application> translation project consists of
    a number of files and folders.</para>

    <para>When you create a translation project, OmegaT automatically creates
    a folder with the specified name, and a list of folders:</para>

    <figure id="OmegaT.project">
      <title>OmegaT project</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject role="html">
		          <imagedata fileref="images/Omegatproject.png"/>
       </imageobject>
      <imageobject role="fo">
          <imagedata fileref="images/Omegatproject.png" width="60%"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
	  </figure>

    <para>Alternate locations for some of the folders can be chosen at project
    creation or during the translation. It is therefore possible to select
    existing folders or create folders in locations that reflect your work
    flow and project management habits. To change the location of folders
    after a project has been created, open <guimenuitem>Project &gt;
    Properties...</guimenuitem> in the menu or with
    <guibutton>Ctrl+E</guibutton> and make the necessary changes.</para>

    <para>In a file manager a translation project looks and acts just like any
    other folder. In the following example the folder <filename>my
    projects</filename> contains three OmegaT projects:</para>

    <para><figure id="OmegaT.projects.and.subfolders">
        <title>OmegaT projects and subfolders</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure></para>

    <para>Double clicking the item with the OmegaT icon is sufficient to open
    the project. A translation project <emphasis role="bold">Example_Project</emphasis> created with the default settings
    will be created as a new subfolder with the following structure:</para>

    <section id="file.omegat.project">
      <title>Top folder<indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Project files</primary>

          <secondary>File omegat.project</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>Top folder of a project always contains the file<filename>
      OmegaT.Project</filename>, containing project parameters as defined in
      the Project properties window (<guimenuitem>Project &gt;
      Properties</guimenuitem>). While the translation is progressing,
      additional files
      (<emphasis><filename>project_name</filename></emphasis><filename>-omegat.tmx,
      project_name-level1.tmx and project_name-level2.tmx</filename>) are
      created (and updated during the process of translation) in this folder.
      They contain the one and the same translation memory contents in
      different forms, to be used in future projects.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Subfolder dictionary</title>

      <para>Initially empty, this folder will contain dictionaries you have
      added to the project. See <link linkend="chapter.dictionaries">chapter

          <primary>Project files</primary>

          <secondary>Subfolder omegat</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>The <emphasis role="bold">omegat</emphasis> subfolder contains at
      least one and possibly several other files. The most important file here
      is the <filename>project_save.tmx, </filename>that is the working
      translation memory for the project. Backups of this file (with extension
      bak) are added progressively to this subfolder, first at the beginning
      of the translation session, at its end, and while the translation
      progresses. This way an inadvertent data loss is averted - see
      Preventing Data Loss in chapter <link linkend="chapter.misc">Miscellanea.</link></para>

    <para>OmegaT is supplied as a package that can be downloaded from
    SourceForge. Here a platform-independent package in a standard Java form
    is considered. Alternatives include a Linux .tar package, a Windows
    installer – with or without a Java Runtime Environment –, a Mac OS X
    installer, and a source code package for developers.</para>

    <para>The platform-independent package can be used on any platform with a
    working Java 1.6 runtime environment, including the platforms for which a
    specific package also exists. It is provided as a compressed file (zip or
    tar archive) that you must extract to the folder of your choice for
    installation. The file can usually be extracted by double-clicking on the
    downloaded package. Once the archive has been extracted, a folder
    containing the following contents is created:</para>

    <para><application>You can use OmegaT</application> to translate files in
    a number of file formats. There are basically two types of file formats,
    plain text and formatted text.</para>

      <title>Plain text files<indexterm class="singular">

          <primary>Source files</primary>

          <secondary>Plain text files</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>Plain text files contain text only, so their translation is as
      simple as typing the translation. There are several methods to specify
      the file's encoding so that its contents are not garbled when opened in
      <application>OmegaT</application>. Such files do not contain any
      formatting information beyond the "white space" used to align text,
      indicate paragraphs or insert page breaks. They are not able to contain
      or retain information regarding the color, font etc of the text.
      Currently, <application>OmegaT</application> supports the following
      plain text formats:<indexterm class="singular">

      <para>Other plain text file types can be handled by

      project_save.tmx as the default translation. In case, however, the same
      source segment already exists with a different translation, the new
      translation will be saved as an alternative.</para>

      <para>Formatted text files contain information such as font type, size,
      color etc. as well as text. They are commonly created in word processors
      or HTML editors. Such file formats are designed to hold formatting
      information. The formatting information can be as simple as “this is
      bold”, or as complex as table data with different font sizes, colors,
      positions, etc. In most translation jobs, it is considered important for
      the formatting of the original text to be retained in the translation.
      OmegaT allows you to do this by marking the characters/words that have a
      special formatting with easy-to-handle tags. Simplifying the original
      text formatting greatly contributes to reducing the number of tags.
      Where possible, unifying the fonts, font sizes, colors, etc. used in the
      document simplifies the task of translation and reduces the possible
      number of tag errors. Each file type is handled differently in OmegaT.
      Specific behavior can be set up in the file filters. At the time of
      writing, OmegaT supports the following formatted text formats:

      <para>When writing purely RTL text, the default (LTR) view may be used.
      In many cases, however, it is necessary to embed LTR text in RTL text.
      For example, in OmegaT tags, product names that must be left in the LTR
      source language, place holders in localization files, and numbers in
      text. In cases like these it becomes necessary to switch to RTL mode, so
      that the RTL (in fact bidirectional) text is displayed correctly. It
      should be noted that when <application>OmegaT</application> is in RTL
      mode, both source and target are displayed in RTL mode. This means that
      if the source language is LTR and the target language is RTL, or vice
      versa, it may be necessary to toggle back and forth between RTL and LTR
      modes to view the source and enter the target easily in their respective
      modes.</para>

      <para>As stated above, OmegaT tags are LTR strings. When translating
      between RTL and LTR languages, correctly reading the tags from the
      source and entering them properly in the target may require the
      translator to toggle between LTR and RTL modes numerous times.</para>

      <para>If the document allows, the translator is strongly encouraged to
      remove style information from the original document so that as few tags
      as possible appear in the OmegaT interface. Follow the indications given
      in Hints for tags management. Frequently validate tags (see Tag
      validation) and produce translated documents (see below and Menu) at
      regular intervals to make it easier to catch any problems that arise. A
      hint: translating a plain text version of the text and adding the
      necessary style in the relevant application at a later stage may turn
      out to be less hassle.</para>

  <para>Formatting information present in the source file usually needs to be

  possible by the supported formats (in particular DocBook, HTML, XHTML, Open
  Document Format(ODF) and Office Open XML (MS Office 2007 and later) at
  the time of writing) is presented as tags in OmegaT. Normally tags are
  ignored when considering the similarity between different texts for matching
  purposes. Tags reproduced in the translated segment will be present in the

    <para>The tags consist of one to three characters and a number. Unique
    numbering allows tags, corresponding to each other to be grouped together
    and differentiates between tags, that have the same shortcut character,
    but are in fact different. The shortcut characters used try to reflect the
    underlying meaning of the tag (e.g. b for bold, i for italics,

    <para>Tags are numbered incrementally by tag group. "Tag groups" in this

    segment, the first group (pair or single) receives the number 0, the

    <para><application>OmegaT</application> creates its tags before the
    process of sentence segmenting. Depending upon the segmenting rules, the

    <para>Care must be exercised with tags. If they are accidentally changed,
    the formatting of the final file may be corrupted. The basic rule is that
    the sequence of tags must be preserved in the same order. However, it is

    <para>Modifying tag group order may result in the nesting of a tag group

    and fail to open.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Simplify the original text</emphasis></para>

    <para>Tags generally represent formatting in some form of the original
    text. Simplifying the original formatting greatly contributes to reducing
    the number of tags. Where circumstances permit, unifying used fonts, font
    sizes, colors, etc. should be considered, as it could simplify the
    translation and reduce the potential for tag errors. Read the tag
    operations section to see what can be done with tags. Remember that if you
    find tags a problem in OmegaT and formatting is not extremely relevant for
    the current translation, removing tags may be the easiest way out of
    problems.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Pay extra attention to tag
    pairs</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you need to see tags in OmegaT but do not need to retain most of
    the formatting in the translated document you are free not to include tags
    in the translation. In this case pay extra attention to tag pairs since
    deleting one side of the pair but forgetting to delete the other is
    guaranteed to corrupt your document's formatting. Since tags are included
    in the text itself, it is possible to use segmentation rules to create
    segments with fewer tags. This is an advanced feature and some experience
    is required in order for it to be applied properly.</para>

    <para>OmegaT is not yet able to detect mistakes in formatting fully
    automatically, so it will not prompt you if you make an error or change
    formatting to fit your target language better. Sometimes, however, your
    translated file may look strange, and – in the worst case – may even
    refuse to open.</para>

            <para>Sometimes, it is useful to distinguish between high-quality
            translation memories and those that are, because of the subject
            matter, client, revision status, etc., less reliable. For
            translation memories in folders with a name "penalty-xxx" (with
            xxx between 0 and 100), matches will be degraded according to the
            name of the folder: a 100% match in any of TMs, residing in a
            folder called Penalty-30 for instance, will be lowered to a 70%
            match. The penalty applies to all three match percentages: matches
            75, 80, 90 will in this case be lowered to 45, 50, 60.</para>

      <para>Optionally, you can let <application>OmegaT</application> have an
      additional tmx file (<application>OmegaT</application>-style) anywhere
      you specify, containing all translatable segments of the project. See
      pseudo-translated memory below.</para>

      <para>Note that all the translation memories are loaded into memory when
      the project is opened. Back-ups of the project translation memory are
      produced regularly (see next chapter), and
      <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> is also saved/updated when the
      project is closed or loaded again. This means for instance that you do
      not need to exit a project you are currently working on if you decide to
      add another ancillary TM to it: you simply reload the project, and the
      changes you have made will be included.</para>

      <para>The locations of the various different translation memories for a
      given project are user-defined (see Project dialog window in <link linkend="chapter.project.properties">Project properties)</link></para>

      <para>Depending on the situation, different strategies are thus
      possible, for instance:</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">several projects on the same subject:
      </emphasis>keep the project structure, and change source and target
      folders (Source = source/order1, target = target/order1 etc). Note
      that you segments from order1, that are not present in order2 and other
      subsequent jobs, will be tagged as orphan segments; however, they will
      still be useful for getting fuzzy matches.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">several translators working on the same
      project:</emphasis> split the source files into source/Alice,
      source/Bob... and allocate them to team members (Alice, Bob ...). They
      can then create their own projects and, deliver their own
      <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>, when finished or when a given
      milestone has been reached. The <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>
      files are then collected and possible conflicts as regards terminology
      for instance get resolved. A new version of the master TM is then
      created, either to be put in team members'
      <emphasis>tm/auto</emphasis>subfolders or to replace their
      <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> files. The team can also use the
      same subfolder structure for the target files. This allows them for
      instance to check at any moment, whether the target version for the
      complete project is still OK</para>

      <para>Tmx files contain translation units, made of a number of
      equivalent segments in several languages. A translation unit comprises
      at least two translation unit variants (TUV). Either can be used as the
      source or target.</para>

      <para>The settings in your project indicate which is the source and
      which the target language. OmegaT thus takes the TUV segments
      corresponding to the project's source and target language codes and uses
      them as the source and target segments respectively. OmegaT recognizes
      the language codes using the following two standard conventions :</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>2 letters (e.g. JA for Japanese), or</para>

          partial list of language and country codes).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If the project language codes and the tmx language codes fully
      match, the segments are loaded in memory. If languages match but not the
      country, the segments still get loaded. If neither the language code not
      the country code match, the segments will be ignored.</para>

      loaded, regardless of the language. For instance, if the language pair
      of the project is DE-FR, it can be still be of some help to see hits in

    <para>Initially, that is when the project is created, the main TM of the
    project, <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> is empty. This TM gradually
    becomes filled during the translation. To speed up this process, existing
    translations can be reused. If a given sentence has already been
    translated once, and translated correctly, there is no need for it to be
    retranslated. Translation memories may also contain reference
    translations: multinational legislation, such as that of the European
    Community, is a typical example.</para>

    <para>When you create the target documents in an
    <application>OmegaT</application> project, the translation memory of the
    project is output in the form of three files in the root folder of your
    <application>OmegaT</application> project (see the above description). You
    can regard these three tmx files (<filename>-omegat.tmx</filename>,
    <filename>-level1.tmx</filename> and <filename>-level2.tmx</filename>) as
    an "export translation memory", i.e. as an export of your current
    project's content in bilingual form.</para>

    <para>Should you wish to reuse a translation memory from a previous
    project (for example because the new project is similar to the previous
    project, or uses terminology which might have been used before), you can
    use these translation memories as "input translation memories", i.e. for
    import into your new project. In this case, place the translation memories
    you wish to use in the <emphasis>/tm</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>/tm</emphasis>/auto folder of your new project: in the former
    case you will get hits from these translation memories in the fuzzy
    matches viewer, and in the latter case these TMs will be used to
    pre-translate your source text.</para>

    <para>By default, the /tm folder is below the project's root folder (e.g.
    ...<emphasis>/MyProject/tm</emphasis>), but you can choose a different
    folder in the project properties dialog if you wish. This is useful if you
    frequently use translation memories produced in the past, for example
    because they are on the same subject or for the same customer. In this
    case, a useful procedure would be:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Create a folder (a "repository folder") in a convenient location
        on your hard drive for the translation memories for a particular

        folder.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Note that all the tmx files in the /tm repository are parsed when
    the project is opened, so putting all different TMs you may have on hand
    into this folder may unnecessarily slow OmegaT down. You may even consider
    removing those that are not required any more, once you have used their
    contents to fill up the <filename>project-save.tmx</filename> file.</para>

      <para>OmegaT supports imported tmx versions 1.1-1.4b (both level 1 and
      level 2). This enables the translation memories produced by other tools
      to be read by OmegaT. However, OmegaT does not fully support imported
      level 2 tmx files (these store not only the translation, but also the
      formatting). Level 2 tmx files will still be imported and their textual
      content can be seen in OmegaT, but the quality of fuzzy matches will be
      somewhat lower.</para>

      <para>OmegaT follows very strict procedures when loading translation
      memory (tmx) files. If an error is found in such a file, OmegaT will
      indicate the position within the defective file at which the error is
      located.</para>

      <para>Some tools are known to produce invalid tmx files under certain
      conditions. If you wish to use such files as reference translations in
      OmegaT, they must be repaired, or OmegaT will report an error and fail
      to load them. Fixes are trivial operations and OmegaT assists
      troubleshooting with the related error message. You can ask the user
      group for advice if you have problems.</para>

      <para>OmegaT exports version 1.4 TMX files (both level 1 and level 2).
      The level 2 export is not fully compliant with the level 2 standard, but
      is sufficiently close and will generate correct matches in other
      translation memory tools supporting TMX Level 2. If you only need
      textual information (and not formatting information), use the level 1
      file that OmegaT has created.</para>

      <para>There may be cases where you have done a project with e.g. Dutch
      sources, and a translation in say English. Then you need a translation
      in e.g. Chinese, but your translator does not understand Dutch; she,
      however, understands perfectly English. In this case NL-EN translation
      memory can serve as a go-between to help generate NL-ZH
      translation.</para>

      <para>The solution in our example is to copy the existing translation
      memory into the tm subfolder and rename it ZH_CN.tmx to indicate the
      target language of the tmx. The translator will be shown English
      translations for source segments in Dutch and use them to create the
      Chinese translation.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Important: </emphasis>the supporting TMX
      must be renamed XX_YY.tmx, where XX_YY is the target language of the
      tmx, for instance to ZH_CN.tmx in the example above. The project and TMX
      source languages should of course be identical - NL in our example. Note
      that only one TMX for a given language pair is possible, so if several
      translation memories should be involved, you will need to merge them all

    <para>Some types of source files (for instance PO, TTX, etc.) are
    bilingual, i.e. they serve both as a source and as a translation memory.
    In such cases, an existing translation, found in the file, is included in
    the <filename>project_save.tmx</filename>. It is treated as a default
    translation, if no match has been found, or as an alternative translation,
    in case the same source segment exists, but with a target text. The result
    will thus depend on the order in which the source segments have been
    loaded.</para>

    <para>All translations from source documents are also displayed in the

    an 80% match). The word [Fuzzy] is displayed on the source segment.</para>

    <para>When you load a segmented TTX file, segments with source = target
    will be included, if "Allow translation to be equal to source" in Options

    <para>Before segments get translated, you may wish to pre-process them or

  <title>Source segmentation</title>

  <para>Translation memory tools work with textual units called segments.
  <application>OmegaT</application> has two ways to segment a text: by
  paragraph or by sentence segmentation (also referred to as “rule-based
  segmentation”). In order to select the type of segmentation, select
  <menuchoice>
      <guimenu><indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Project</primary>

          <secondary>Properties</secondary>
        </indexterm>Project</guimenu>

      <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice> from the main menu and tick or untick the check box
  provided. Paragraph segmentation is advantageous in certain cases, such as
  highly creative or stylistic translations in which the translator may wish
  to change the order of entire sentences; for the majority of projects,
  however, sentence segmentation is a choice to be preferred, since it
  delivers better matches from previous translations. If sentence segmentation
  has been selected, you can setup the rules by selecting <menuchoice>
      <guimenu><indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Project</primary>

          <secondary>Options</secondary>
        </indexterm>Options</guimenu>

      <guimenuitem>Segmentation...</guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>from the main menu.</para>

  <para>Dependable segmentation rules are already available for many
  languages, so it is likely that you will not need to get involved with
  writing your own segmentation rules. On the other hand this functionality
  can be very useful in special cases, where you can increase your
  productivity by tuning the segmentation rules to the text to be
  translated.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Warning: </emphasis>because the text will
  segment differently after filter options have been changed, so you may have
  to start translating from scratch. At the same time the previous valid
  segments in the project translation memory will turn into orphan segments.
  If you change segmentation options when a project is open, you must reload
  the project in order for the changes to take effect.</para>

  <para><application>OmegaT</application> uses the following sequence of
  steps:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>

      <listitem>
        <para><application>OmegaT</application> first parses the text for
        structure-level segmentation. During this process it is only the
        structure of the source file that is used to produce segments.</para>

        <para>For example, text files may be segmented on line breaks, empty
        lines, or not be segmented at all. Files containing formatting
        (ODF documents, HTML documents, etc.) are segmented on the
        block-level (paragraph) tags. Translatable object attributes in XHTML
        or HTML files can be extracted as separate segments.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>After segmenting the source file into structural units,
        <application>OmegaT</application> will segment these blocks further
        into sentences.</para>

        <primary>Segmentation</primary>

        <secondary>Rules</secondary>
      </indexterm></title>

    <para>The process of segmenting can be pictured as follows: the cursor
    moves along the text, one character at a time. At each cursor position
    rules, consisting of a <emphasis role="bold">Before </emphasis>and
    <emphasis role="bold">After </emphasis>pattern, are applied in their given
    order to see if any of the<emphasis role="bold"> Before</emphasis>
    patterns are valid for the text on the left and the corresponding
    <emphasis role="bold">After</emphasis> pattern for the text on the right
    of the cursor. If the rule matches, either the cursor moves on without
    inserting a segment break (for an exception rule) or a new segment break
    is created at the current cursor position (for the break rule).</para>

    <para>The two types of rules behave as follows:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><indexterm class="singular">
            <primary>Segmentation</primary>

            <secondary>Rules</secondary>

            <tertiary>Break rule</tertiary>
          </indexterm>Break rule</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>Separates the source text into segments. For example,
          "<emphasis>Did it make sense? I was not sure</emphasis>." should be
          split into two segments. For this to happen, there should be a break
          rule for "?", when followed by spaces and a capitalized word. To
          define a rule as a break rule, tick the Break/Exception check
          box.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><indexterm class="singular">
            <primary>Segmentation</primary>

            <secondary>Rules</secondary>

            <tertiary>Exception rule</tertiary>
          </indexterm>Exception rule</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>specify what parts of text should NOT be separated. In spite
          of the period, <emphasis>"Mrs. Dalloway "</emphasis> should not be
          split in two segments, so an exception rule should be established
          for Mrs (and for Mr, for Dr, for prof etc), followed by a period. To
          define a rule as an exception rule, leave the Break/Exception check
          box unticked.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>The predefined break rules should be sufficient for most European
    languages and Japanese. In view of the flexibility, you may consider
    defining more exception rules for your source language in order to provide
    more meaningful and coherent segments.</para>

      </indexterm></title>

    <para>All segmentation rule sets for a matching language pattern are
    active and are applied in the given order of priority, so rules for
    specific language should be higher than default ones. For example, rules
    for Canadian French (FR-CA) should be set higher than rules for French
    (FR.*), and higher than Default (.*) ones. Thus, when translating from
    Canadian French the rules for Canadian French - if any - will be applied
    first, followed by the rules for French and lastly, by the Default
    rules.</para>

    <para>Major changes to the segmentation rules should be generally avoided,
    especially after completion of the first draft, but minor changes, such as
    the addition of a recognized abbreviation, can be advantageous.</para>

    <para>In order to edit or expand an existing set of rules, simply click on
    it in the top table. The rules for that set will appear in the bottom half
    of the window.</para>

    <para>In order to create an empty set of rules for a new language pattern
    click <emphasis role="bold">Add </emphasis>in the upper half of the
    dialog. An empty line will appear at the bottom of the upper table (you
    may have to scroll down to see it). Change the name of the rule set and
    the language pattern to the language concerned and its code (see <xref linkend="appendix.languages"/> for a list of language codes). The syntax
    of the language pattern conforms to regular expression syntax. If your set
    of rules handles a language-country pair, we advise you to move it to the
    top using the <emphasis role="bold">Move Up</emphasis> button.</para>

    <para>Add the <emphasis role="bold">Before</emphasis> and<emphasis role="bold"> After</emphasis> patterns. To check their syntax and their
    applicability, it is advisable to use tools which allow you to see their
    effect directly. See the chapter on <link linkend="chapter.regexp">Regular

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Search for segments containing the exact string you specified.
          An exact search looks for a phrase, i.e. if several words are
          entered, they are found only if they occur in exactly that sequence.
          Searching for <literal>open file</literal> will thus find all
          occurrences of the string <emphasis><literal>open
          file</literal></emphasis>, but not <emphasis><literal>file

          similar to a search "with all of the words" in an Internet search
          engine such as Google (AND logic). Using keyword search with
          <emphasis><literal>open file</literal></emphasis> will thus find all
          occurrences of the string <emphasis><literal>open
          file</literal>,</emphasis> as well as <emphasis><literal>file

    <para>A number of interactive tools are available to develop and test
    regular expressions. They generally follow much the same pattern (for an
    example from the Regular Expression Tester see below): the regular

    yielding the hits, shown in the result Text box.</para>

  <para>Glossaries are files created and updated manually for use in
  <application>OmegaT</application>.</para>

  <para>If an <application>OmegaT</application> project contains one or more
  glossaries, any terms in the glossary which are also found in the current
  segment will be automatically displayed in the Glossary viewer.</para>

  <para>You define its location and name in the project properties dialog. The
  extension must be <filename>.txt</filename>(if not, it will be added). The
  location of the file must be within the <filename>/glossary</filename>folder, 
  but it can be in a deeper folder (e.g.,
  <filename>glossary/sub/glossary.txt</filename>). The file does not need to
  exist when setting it, it will be created (if necessary) when adding a
  glossary entry. If the file already exists, no attempt is done to verify the
  format or the character set of the file: the new entries will always be in
  tab-separated format and UTF-8. As the existing content will not be touched,
  damage to an existing file would be limited.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>To use an existing glossary, simply place it in the<indexterm class="singular">
        <primary>Project files</primary>

        <secondary>Glossary subfolder</secondary>
      </indexterm> <filename>/glossary</filename> folder after creating the
    project. <application>OmegaT</application> automatically detects glossary
    files in this folder when a project is opened. Terms in the current
    segment which <application>OmegaT</application> finds in the glossary
    file(s) are displayed in the Glossary pane:</para>

    <para>The word before the = sign is the source term, and its translation
    is (or are) the words after =. The vocabulary entry can have a comment
    added. The glossary function only finds exact matches with the glossary
    entry (e.g. does not find inflected forms etc.). New terms can be added
    manually to the glossary file(s) during translation, for example in a text
    editor. Newly added terms will not be recognized once the changes in the
    text file have been saved.</para>

    <para>The source term does not have to be a single-word item, as the next
    example shows:</para>

    <para>The underlined item "pop-up menu" can be found in the glossary pane
    as "pojavni menu". Highlighting it in the Glossary pane and then
    rightclicking insets at the cursor position in the target
    segment.<footnote>
        <para>Note that in the above case, this is just half (or even less) of
        the story, as the target language (Slovenian) uses declension. So the
        inserted "pojavni meni" in the nominative form - has to be changed to
        "pojavnem meniju" , i.e. to the locative. So it is probably faster to
        type the term correctly right away without bothering with the glossary
        and its shortcuts.</para>

    <para>Glossary files are simple plain text files containing three-column,
    tab-delimited lists with the source and target terms in the first and
    second columns respectively. The third column can be used for additional
    information. You can have entries with the target column missing, i.e.
    just containing the source term and the comment.</para>

    <para>Glossary files can be either in system default encoding (and
    indicated by the extension .tab) or in UTF-8 (the extension .utf8). The
    Unicode encoding (UTF8) is preferred for obvious reasons. Also supported
    is the CSV format. This format is the same as the tab separated one:
    source term, target term. Comment fields are separated by a comma ','.
    Strings can be enclosed by quotes ", which allows having a comma inside a
    string:</para>

    <para><literal>"This is a source term, which contains a comma","c'est un
    terme, qui contient une virgule"</literal></para>

    <para>In addition to the plain text format, TBX format <indexterm class="singular">
        <primary>Glossaries</primary>

        <secondary>TBX format</secondary>
      </indexterm> is also supported. TBX - Term Base eXchange - is the open,
    XML-based standard for exchanging structured terminological data, TBX has
    been approved as an international standard by LISA and ISO. If you have an
    existing terminology handling system - MultiTerm for example - it is quite
    possible it offers the export of terminology data via TBX format. <ulink url="http://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Terminology.aspx">Microsoft

      </indexterm></title>

    <para>The project setting allows one can enter a name for a writable
    glossary file (see beginning of this chapter). Right-click in the glossary
    pane or press <keycap>Ctrl+Shift+G</keycap> to add a new entry. A dialog
    opens, allowing you to enter the source term, target term and any comments
    you may have:</para>

    </mediaobject>

    <para>The contents of glossary files are kept in memory and are loaded
    when the project is opened or reloaded. Updating a glossary file is thus
    rather simple: press <keycap>Ctrl+Shift+G</keycap> and enter the new
    term, its translation and any comments you may have (ensuring you press
    tab between the fields) and save the file. The contents of the glossary
    pane will be updated accordingly.</para>

    speaks against using Notepad++ on Windows, GEdit on Linux for instance or

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Important: </emphasis>Google Translate API v2
    requires billing information for all accounts before you can start using
    the service (see <ulink url="https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/pricing?hl=en-US">Pricing

    section Launch command arguments, for details on how to add this key to

    <para>The quality of the Google Translate translation depends on one side
    on the reservoir of target-language texts and the availability of their

  <para>OmegaT has a built-in spell checker based on the spelling checker used

  consequently able to use the huge range of free spelling dictionaries
  available for these applications.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Installing spelling dictionaries</title>

    <para>Before the spell check function can be used, a suitable dictionary
    or dictionaries (i.e. for your target language) must be installed. To
    install spelling dictionaries, follow this procedure:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In your file manager, create a new folder in a suitable location
        in which to store spelling dictionaries (D:\Translations\spellcheckers
        in the example below).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In OmegaT, select <guisubmenu><indexterm class="singular">
            <primary>Menu Options</primary>

            <secondary>Spell checking</secondary>
          </indexterm></guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Options &gt; Spell
        Checking</guimenuitem>, then click <guibutton>Choose
        </guibutton>beside the Dictionary file folder field. Navigate to and
        select the folder you created for dictionaries.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Place the dictionary files you wish to use in this folder. There
        are essentially two ways in which you can do this. You can either copy
        files manually, i.e. from elsewhere on your system, using your file
        manager; or you can use OmegaT's <emphasis role="bold">"Install new
        dictionary"</emphasis> function to provide a list of available
        dictionaries to select from. Note that the "Install" function requires
        an Internet connection. The selected languages will then be installed
        and will eventually appear in your spell checker setup window (this
        may take a while).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Copying the files manually makes sense if you already have suitable
    dictionary files on your system, for instance as part of your Apache OpenOffice,
    LibreOffice, Firefox or Thunderbird installation. It is simpler, however, to look for

    <para>Clicking on <guibutton>Install new dictionary</guibutton> button
    will open the Dictionary installer window, where you can select the
    dictionaries you want to install.</para>

    <para>The names of the files must correspond to the language code of your
    target language as defined in the project properties dialog
    (<guimenu>Project &gt; Properties</guimenu>). For example, if you have
    selected ES-MX (Mexican Spanish) as the target language, the dictionary
    files must be named es_MX.dic and es_MX.aff. If you only have a standard
    Spanish dictionary available, with file names es_es.dic and es_es.aff for
    instance, you can copy these files to es_MX.dic and es_MX.aff, and the
    spelling dictionary will work. Note that this will of course check for the
    standard (Castillian) rather than for Mexican Spanish.</para>

    <title>Using spelling dictionaries</title>

    <para>There is no need to instruct OmegaT to use a particular spelling
    dictionary; OmegaT will use the correct language dictionary based upon the
    language codes of your project. Check however that the language codes are
    exactly the same: an FR-FR dictionary will not work with an FR target
    setting, for example. If necessary, edit the file names of the dictionary
    or change your project's language settings.</para>

    <para>To enable the spell checker, select <guimenuitem>Options &gt; Spell
    Checking</guimenuitem> and tick the <guilabel>Automatically check the
    spelling of text</guilabel> check box (see above).</para>

    <para>If the spell checker is not working, then make sure first that the
    check box <guilabel>"Automatically check the spelling of text"</guilabel>
    in the spell checker dialog (<guisubmenu>Options &gt; Spell
    checking...)</guisubmenu> is checked.</para>

    <para>Also check that the target language code of your project against the
    available vocabularies in the setup window. The spell checker uses the
    target language code to determine the language to be used : if the target
    language is Brazilian Portuguese (PT_BR), the subfolder with vocabularies
    must contain the two vocabulary files, called
    <emphasis>pt_br.aff</emphasis> and <emphasis>pt_br.dic</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>If you have already translated a large body of text, and then
    realize the target language code of the project does not match the spell
    checker's language code (you specified pt_BR as the language, but there
    are no pt_BR vocabularies, for instance) you can simply copy the two
    corresponding files and rename them (e.g. from
    <emphasis>pt_PT.aff</emphasis> and <emphasis>pt_PT.dic</emphasis> to
    <emphasis>pt_BR.aff</emphasis> and <emphasis>pt_BR.dic</emphasis>). Of
    course it is much wiser, to take a short break and download the correct
    versions of the spell checker.</para>

    <para>Note that <filename>Remove</filename> physically removes the
    selected vocabularies. If they are used by some other application on your
    system, they will disappear from that application, too. If, for whatever
    reason, you need to do this from time to time, it may make sense to copy
    the files involved to a different folder, reserved just for use by
    OmegaT.</para>

    <para>The purpose of the console (i.e. command line) mode is to permit the
    use <application>of OmegaT</application> as translation tool in a
    scripting environment. When launched in console mode, no GUI is loaded (
    it will work therefore on any console) and the given project is
    automatically translated. An example would be a software project, with GUI
    localized in a number of languages. Using the console mode, one can make
    generating a localized interface a part of the build process.</para>

      <para>To run OmegaT, a valid OmegaT project must be available. The
      location is irrelevant, since it must be specified explicitly on the
      command-line at launch.</para>

      <para>If you need non-standard settings, the corresponding configuration
      files (<literal>filters.conf</literal> and

    <para><application>OmegaT</application> is a robust application. However,
    you should take precautions against data loss when using
    <application>OmegaT</application>, just as with any other application.
    When you translate your files, <application>OmegaT</application> stores
    all your progress in the translation memory
    <literal>project_save.tmx</literal> that resides in the project's
    <literal>/omegat</literal> subfolder.</para>

    <para>OmegaT also backs up the translation memory to
    project_save.tmx.YEARMMDDHHNN.bak in the same subfolder each time a
    project is opened or reloaded. YEAR is the 4-digit year, MM is the month,
    DD the day of the month, and HH and NN are the hours and minutes when the
    previous translation memory was saved.</para>

    <para>If you believe that you have lost translation data, you can use the
    following procedure to restore the project to its most recently saved
    state, usually not older than approximately 10 minutes or so:</para>

    <orderedlist>

    <title>Version control - introduction</title>

    <para>The collaborative translation offered by OmegaT is based on the
    functionality of version or revision control, widely used by the software
    community to maintain control of changes to the code of a program and
    allow unimpeded collaboration within the development team. OmegaT supports
    two of the popular version control systems (VCS for short), <ulink url="http://subversion.apache.org">Apache Subversion</ulink> (often
    abbreviated SVN, after the command name svn) and <ulink url="http://git-scm.com/">Git</ulink>. The advantages of a VC system for
    a team of translators can be summarized as follows:</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">VCS server - </emphasis>i.e. SVN or Git
        server is the environment where the common material is kept and
        maintained on the net. The server can exist in the local network but
        in the majority of cases it will be available on internet, i.e. via
        URL address. One member of the team, the project administrator, needs
        to be acquainted with handling the server side, i.e. the job of setting
        up the environment, importing the OmegaT project, assigning the access
        rights for the team members, resolving the conflicts, etc.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">VCS client: </emphasis>To interface with
        the server an SVN or Git client must be installed on computers of "project managers"
        involved in the OmegaT project. Very popular clients for Windows

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">repository: </emphasis>the place where the

        network or in Internet. Project members connect with it via their VCS
        client.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">checkout:</emphasis> the operation that
        creates a working copy from the repository to your local computer. The

        <primary>Team projects</primary>

        <secondary>Subversion</secondary>
      </indexterm></title>

    <para>There are two possibilities to run an SVN server: you can install SVN
    on your own server or you can use a hosted service. When using an external
    service you must be aware of the possible implications in terms of
    confidentiality, since you are loading the original document on a server
    outside of your direct control. Alternatively, to avoid this issue you can
    set a private SVN server, for example if you already have an Apache server
    that includes the software in question (e.g. VisualSVN).</para>

    <para>Once the SVN server is available, project managers must
    locally install a SVN client, in order to manage the project contents on
    their computers. For Windows we recommend <ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</ulink>. For Mac you can
    download the client for instance from <ulink url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/macsvn/">SourceForge</ulink>, For
    Linux see <ulink url="www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/Subversion.html">Subversion Commands and
    Scripts</ulink>.</para>

          <secondary>Creating SVN repository</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>The procedure presented here relies on the free SVN server
      (limited to 2 users) offered by <ulink url="http://projectlocker.com/">ProjectLocker</ulink>. Note that the creator
      of the repository has implicitly the administrator rights for the
      repository created. Sign in to the site first or - if it is your first
      time on the site, register for it and note your user name and password
      for the future projects.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Create a new project on ProjectLocker</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Type the name and description of the repository. (
          <literal>OmegaT</literal> and <literal>OmegaT SL Localization
          </literal>in the example used here)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

          <para>Click <guibutton>Create Project</guibutton></para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Open the<emphasis role="bold"> Projects</emphasis> view for your
      account. The URL shown under Project Services will be used by SVN to
      connect clients to the SVN server you have just established. This is
      also the place to add members of the team to the project and assign them
      their rights. Note that the team members have to be registered first,
      before you can add them to the project (Note: in the free version of
      ProjectLocker you are allowed only two users per project).</para>

      <para>Projects can be managed according to your development style and
      needs. Similar as in the case of OmegaT projects, you will need to have
      separate repositories for different language pairs. Within a given
      language pair it is best to keep different subjects and/or clients as
      separate repositories as well. The alternative is to have one single
      repository with subfolders <literal>Project1</literal>, <literal>Project2</literal>, etc.,
      and share the common material via common <literal>tm</literal>, <literal>glossary</literal>
      and <literal>dictionary</literal> folders.</para>

      <para>For the example shown here we decided for the one OmegaT project -
      one single repository for the simplicity reasons.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Importing the project to SVN repository - Windows</title>

      <para>The repository is empty at this moment. You create first an empty
      client folder on your disk. Create an empty folder, where you will keep
      your project and right-click on it. Select<guilabel> TortoiseSVN &gt;
      Checkout.</guilabel> The following dialog appears:</para>
 
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject role="html">
          <imagedata fileref="images/Team_projects_checkout.png"/>
        </imageobject>
		<imageobject role="fo">
          <imagedata fileref="images/Team_projects_checkout.png" width="80%"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
 
      <para>Enter the URL, provided by ProjectLocker, into the field
      <emphasis role="bold">URL of repository</emphasis>. Make sure the field
      <emphasis role="bold">Checkout directory</emphasis> is correct, i.e.
      specifies the empty folder you have created, and press <emphasis role="bold">OK</emphasis>. Once the operation has finished, you can
      check the said folder: it should now contain a subfolder .svn and a
      green OK badge on its icon will show, that the contents of the folder
      are up-to-date:</para>

      <para>In the next step, we will add the OmegaT files to the local
      folder. The following files are to be shared among the members of the
      team and thus have to be included in any case:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the omegat project file -
          <filename>omegat.project</filename></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the translation memory -
          <filename>omegat\project_save.tmx</filename></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the contents of the source folder</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the project-specific filters definition -
          <filename>omegat\filters.xml</filename></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The administrator may decide to include following folders and
      their contents as well: <filename>tm</filename>, <filename>glossary</filename> and
      <filename>dictionary</filename>. Also
      <filename>ignored_words.txt</filename> and
      <filename>learned_words.txt</filename> in the <filename>omegat</filename> folder may be worth sharing and maintaining on the team
      level. Avoid in any case adding <filename>bak</filename> files,
      <filename>project_stats.txt</filename> and
      <filename>project_stats_match.txt</filename>, in the <filename>omegat</filename> subfolder, as
      they would without any need or profit just bloat the repository. You might want to apply the same to
      the <filename>target</filename> folder and its
      contents.</para>

      <para>After copying the required files into the checkout folder you
      will notice that its icon has changed: the green OK badge has changed to
      a red exclamation sign, signifying the change in the local copy of the
      repository. The following two steps will bring the server version up to
      date:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">add the copied files to the local
          version of the repository:</emphasis> right-click on the local
          checkout folder and select <guilabel>TortoiseSVN &gt;
          Add.</guilabel> In the dialog that opens, leave all options as per
          default and click<guilabel> OK</guilabel>. The Add Finished! window,
          similar to the one below will appear:</para>

    <para>Tokenizers (or stemmers) improve the quality of matches by
    recognizing inflected words in source and translation memory data. They
    also improve glossary matching.</para>

    <para>A stemmer for English, for example, should identify the string
    "cats" (and possibly "catlike", "catty" etc.) as based on the root "cat",
    and "stemmer", "stemming", "stemmed" as based on "stem". A stemming
    algorithm reduces the words "fishing", "fished", "fish", and "fisher" to
    the root word, "fish". This is especially useful in case of languages that
    use pre- and postfix forms for the stem words. Borrowing an example from
    Slovenian, here "good" in all possible grammatically correct forms:</para>

    <para>OmegaT-Scripting allows to run scripts written in different
    scripting languages in OmegaT.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Installation and Use</title>

    <para>The Scripting plugin for OmegaT can be downloaded from the <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat-plugins/files">OmegaT plugins
    download site</ulink>. Unzip the files, and put them all in the "plugins"
    folder located in OmegaT installation folder, that is the folder that
    contains the OmegaT.jar. Create the "plugins" folder first, if it does not
    exist.</para>

    <para>This adds a new submenu<guisubmenu> Tools &gt;
    </guisubmenu><guisubmenu>Scripting.</guisubmenu> Below the
    <guisubmenu>Scripting</guisubmenu> submenu , there's 12 place holders
    available for scripts. Clicking <guisubmenu>Scripting</guisubmenu> opens
    the Scripting dialog:<screenshot>

    <para>The Scripting dialog allows you to load an existing script into the
    text area and run it against the current opened project. To customize the
    script feature, do the following:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Load a script into the editor by clicking on its name in the

        <para>Right-click on a button from "&lt;1&gt;" to "&lt;12&gt;" in the
        bottom panel and select "Add". In the above example, two scripts
        (position 1 and 2) have already been added.</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When you left-click on the number, the selected script will run.
        You can start the selected macros from the main menu as well by using

          object model. All existing Java class libraries can be used
          unchanged and without special setup; at the same time, a Java

    <para>Whatever the inconsistencies, omissions and straightforward errors
    you may find in the present version, I declare them all my own. This
